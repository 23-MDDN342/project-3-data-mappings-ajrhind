## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings

This is the final outcome of my third project for my Creative coding class.

The goal was to create a system that maps attributes of the face, and expresses the extrinsic and intrinsic values. It will act as a sort of filter, and use real world data in real time to project onto a photobooth type of thing, using the webcam. 

My design is based on older style birthday clowns. It is meant to be silly and goofy looking. It is made using many custom shapes and follow certain aspects for different parts.

Guide:
Clown lines: Hair colour
Red = Red
Blue = Black
Yellow = Bonde
Green = Brown

Lips: Skin colour
Red = fair
Blue = olive
Yellow = tan
Green = dark

Brows = Brow thickness

Blush circles= Dimples or not

Jawline Colour = makeup or not

Nose Size = how happy they look
